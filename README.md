How do I resolve in raspbian

GitHub Copilot: # DNS Resolution Issue with Captive Portal

The error shows that your Raspberry Pi is trying to connect to package repositories but is being redirected to a captive portal (`portalv6test.actcorp.in`). This indicates you're on an ACT Fibernet network that requires authentication before allowing internet access.

## Steps to resolve:

1. **Complete the captive portal authentication**:
   - Open a web browser on your Raspberry Pi
   - Navigate to any website (like `http://example.com`)
   - You should be redirected to the ACT login page
   - Complete the authentication process

2. **If authentication doesn't resolve the issue**:
   - Try setting up public DNS servers:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
   ```

   - Add these lines (Google DNS):
   ```
   nameserver 8.8.8.8
   nameserver 8.8.4.4
   ```
   - Press Ctrl+O to save, then Ctrl+X to exit

3. **Make DNS changes persistent** (as `/etc/resolv.conf` may be overwritten):
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
   ```
   
   - Add these lines at the end:
   ```
   interface eth0
   static domain_name_servers=8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
   
   interface wlan0
   static domain_name_servers=8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
   ```

4. **Reboot your Raspberry Pi**:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

5. **Test if you can now reach the repositories**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

If the issue persists, you might need to contact your network administrator at ACT Fibernet for assistance with their captive portal system.

User 1: I am able to visit websites without asking for username or password 

So should I DNS servers 

GitHub Copilot: # DNS Setup for Package Repository Access

If you're able to browse websites without authentication but still having the repository errors, then yes, setting up public DNS servers could help. The DNS redirection might be affecting only specific types of traffic (like package repositories) but not regular web browsing.

## Try setting up Google DNS or Cloudflare DNS:

1. **Edit the resolv.conf file**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
   ```
   
   Add:
   ```
   nameserver 8.8.8.8
   nameserver 8.8.4.4
   ```
   
   Or Cloudflare DNS:
   ```
   nameserver 1.1.1.1
   nameserver 1.0.0.1
   ```

2. **Make the changes persistent** in dhcpcd.conf:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
   ```
   
   Add at the end:
   ```
   interface eth0
   static domain_name_servers=8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
   
   interface wlan0
   static domain_name_servers=8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
   ```

3. **Restart networking or reboot**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart networking
   ```
   
   Then try updating again:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

If that doesn't work, the issue might be with your ISP's network configuration specifically blocking apt repositories or applying different routing rules to them.

User 1: 
Failed to restart networking.service: Unit networking.service not found.


GitHub Copilot: # Network Service Restart Error

The error `Unit networking.service not found` indicates that your Raspberry Pi doesn't use the traditional Debian networking service. This is common on Raspbian, which uses different services to manage networking.

## Try these alternatives to restart your network:

1. **Restart the dhcpcd service** (commonly used on Raspberry Pi):
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart dhcpcd
   ```

2. **If you have NetworkManager installed**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
   ```

3. **Restart specific network interfaces**:
   ```bash
   sudo ip link set eth0 down && sudo ip link set eth0 up
   # For WiFi
   sudo ip link set wlan0 down && sudo ip link set wlan0 up
   ```

4. **As a last resort, simply reboot**:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

After restarting your network service with one of these methods, try running `sudo apt update` again to see if your DNS changes have resolved the issue with package repositories.

User 1: sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager

This worked 

however I am still getting act error. Moreover, I have setup PPPoE is the router to avoid credentials. Yet it is still showing issues

GitHub Copilot: # Persistent DNS Issues with ACT Connection

Good to hear that restarting NetworkManager worked. Since you're still experiencing the ACT error despite setting up PPPoE in your router, this suggests a DNS resolution issue on your Raspberry Pi.

## Let's set up persistent DNS changes:

1. **Edit dhcpcd.conf to permanently change DNS servers**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
   ```
   
   Add these lines at the end:
   ```
   # Set static DNS servers for all interfaces
   static domain_name_servers=8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
   ```
   
   Save (Ctrl+O, Enter) and exit (Ctrl+X)

2. **Verify your DNS settings were applied**:
   ```bash
   cat /etc/resolv.conf
   ```
   
   After restarting NetworkManager, you should see Google's DNS servers listed

3. **Test DNS resolution directly**:
   ```bash
   nslookup deb.debian.org 8.8.8.8
   ```
   
   This bypasses your local DNS settings and uses Google DNS directly

4. **If you still have issues, try forcing DNS in apt**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update -o Acquire::ForceIPv4=true
   ```

5. **Check if your router's DHCP is overriding your DNS settings**:
   In some cases, the router may force its own DNS settings. Check your router's DHCP configuration and consider setting the DNS servers there as well.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, there might be additional network filtering happening at the ISP level that requires further troubleshooting.

User 1: sudo apt update -o Acquire::ForceIPv4=true

This worked.. Should I use this apt upgrade as well

GitHub Copilot: # Yes, Use the Same Flag for Upgrade

Since `apt update` worked successfully with the `-o Acquire::ForceIPv4=true` flag, you should use the same flag for `apt upgrade` as well. The same DNS resolution issue that affected the update process would likely affect the upgrade process too.

```bash
sudo apt upgrade -o Acquire::ForceIPv4=true
```

This forces apt to use IPv4 connections instead of IPv6, which appears to be bypassing the DNS redirection issue you're experiencing with your ACT network.

If you want to make this setting permanent (so you don't need to add the flag every time), you can create a configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99force-ipv4
```

Add this line:
```
Acquire::ForceIPv4 "true";
```

Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X) and all future apt commands will use IPv4 by default.

User 1: Perfect. This worked. Help me install pi-hole on my raspberry pi zero 2

GitHub Copilot: # Installing Pi-hole on Raspberry Pi Zero 2

Pi-hole is a network-wide ad blocker that acts as a DNS sinkhole to block unwanted content before it reaches your devices.

## Prerequisites

1. **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 with Raspbian OS installed**
2. **Static IP address** for your Pi (recommended)
3. **SSH access** or direct access via keyboard/monitor

## Installation Steps

### 1. Update your system first

```bash
sudo apt update -o Acquire::ForceIPv4=true
sudo apt upgrade -o Acquire::ForceIPv4=true
```

### 2. Install Pi-hole

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
```

If curl fails, you can try with IPv4 forcing:

```bash
curl -sSL --ipv4 https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
```

### 3. During installation:

- Choose your network interface (typically `wlan0` for Wi-Fi or `eth0` for Ethernet)
- Select your DNS provider (Google, Cloudflare, etc.)
- Accept the default blocklists or add your own
- Enable the web admin interface (recommended)
- Install the web server (lighttpd)
- Enable query logging

### 4. Note your admin password

At the end of installation, Pi-hole will display an admin password. Make note of it, or change it with:

```bash
sudo pihole -a -p
```

## Configuration

### 1. Set a static IP (if you haven't already)

Edit the dhcpcd configuration:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
```

Add these lines (adjust for your network):

```
interface wlan0
static ip_address=192.168.1.2/24
static routers=192.168.1.1
static domain_name_servers=127.0.0.1 8.8.8.8
```

### 2. Configure your router

To use Pi-hole network-wide, configure your router to use your Pi's IP address as the primary DNS server.

## Access the Admin Dashboard

Access the web interface by visiting:
- `http://pi.hole/admin` 
- Or `http://[Your-Pi's-IP]/admin`

## Troubleshooting

- If you see connection issues, ensure IPv4 is used: `curl -4 -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash`
- For DNS resolution issues, try: `sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf` and add `nameserver 8.8.8.8`
- RAM issues: Pi Zero 2 has limited RAM; consider disabling unnecessary services

## Maintenance

Update Pi-hole regularly:

```bash
pihole -up
```

Update your blocklists:

```bash
pihole -g
```

## Recommended next steps

1. Enable HTTPS for the admin interface
2. Set up additional blocklists
3. Configure automatic updates

Let me know if you run into any issues during installation!

User 1: How do I setup static address now. This is test setup for now. Should I also do that or should I go with the exusting connection. I won't restart till my testing is done 

GitHub Copilot: # Setting Up a Static IP Address for Pi-hole

## Should you set up a static IP now?

**Yes, I recommend setting up a static IP address now** even for your test setup. Pi-hole functions as a DNS server for your network, and having a consistent IP address is important for:

1. Allowing devices to reliably connect to Pi-hole
2. Ensuring your router configuration doesn't need frequent updates
3. Preventing connection issues if DHCP assigns a different IP

## How to set up a static IP without immediate restart:

1. **Edit the dhcpcd configuration file**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
   ```

2. **Add these lines** (customize for your network):
   ```
   interface wlan0  # Use eth0 if using Ethernet instead of WiFi
   static ip_address=192.168.1.x/24  # Choose an unused IP on your network
   static routers=192.168.1.1  # Your router's IP address
   static domain_name_servers=127.0.0.1 8.8.8.8  # Pi-hole uses localhost as primary
   ```

3. **Save the file**: Press Ctrl+O, Enter, then Ctrl+X

These changes will take effect after a network restart or system reboot. Since you mentioned not wanting to restart until testing is complete, you can:

1. Continue testing with the current DHCP-assigned IP
2. Configure the static IP so it's ready for when you do restart
3. After testing, restart networking with: `sudo systemctl restart dhcpcd`

## Best practice for Pi-hole testing:

Set up the static IP configuration now, but continue using your current IP for testing. When you're ready to fully implement Pi-hole, restart networking to apply the static IP configuration.

User 1: How do I find my router ip address

GitHub Copilot: # Finding Your Router IP Address on Windows

Your router's IP address (often called the default gateway) can be found using several methods:

## Method 1: Command Prompt

1. Open Command Prompt by pressing `Windows + R` and typing `cmd`
2. Type the following command and press Enter:
   ```
   ipconfig
   ```
3. Look for "Default Gateway" in the output - this is your router's IP address (typically something like 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1)

## Method 2: Settings App

1. Open Settings (Windows key + I)
2. Go to Network & Internet
3. Select your connection (Wi-Fi or Ethernet)
4. Click on "Properties" or "View properties"
5. Scroll down to find "Default gateway" - this is your router's IP address

## Method 3: Control Panel

1. Open Control Panel
2. Go to Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center
3. Click on your connection name
4. Click "Details"
5. Look for "IPv4 Default Gateway"

Once you have the IP address, you can access your router's admin page by typing this address into your web browser.

User 1: Y

GitHub Copilot: # Finding Your Router IP Address on Raspberry Pi

To find your router's IP address (default gateway) on your Raspberry Pi, you can use any of these command line methods:

## Method 1: Using `ip route`

This is the most direct method:

```bash
ip route | grep default
```

The output will look something like:
```
default via 192.168.1.1 dev wlan0 proto dhcp src 192.168.1.100 metric 303
```

Your router's IP address is the number after "default via" (in this example, 192.168.1.1).

## Method 2: Using `route`

```bash
route -n
```

Look for the row with "0.0.0.0" in the destination column. The "Gateway" column shows your router's IP address.

## Method 3: Using `netstat`

```bash
netstat -rn
```

Again, look for the entry with "0.0.0.0" in the destination column.

## Method 4: Check your network connection info

```bash
ifconfig wlan0
```
(Use `eth0` instead of `wlan0` if using Ethernet)

This shows your network configuration including your IP address. Your router is typically at x.x.x.1 in the same subnet.

After finding your router's IP address, you'll need it for configuring Pi-hole's static IP in the dhcpcd.conf file.

This is what it shows

GitHub Copilot: # Network Information Analysis

Based on the network information you've shared, here are the key details about your connection:

## Connection Details
- **SSID**: AC
- **ISP**: ACT Fibernet (based on IP range and DNS servers)
- **Connection Type**: Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) on 5GHz band (channel 44)
- **Speed**: Very good - 702/433 Mbps (receive/transmit)

## Router Information
- **IPv4 Gateway**: Not explicitly shown, but likely 192.168.68.1
- **IPv6 Gateway**: fe80::be07:1dff:fe42:a3a8%24

## DNS Configuration
- **IPv4 DNS Servers**: 49.205.171.194, 49.207.34.210 (ACT Fibernet DNS)

These DNS servers are from ACT Fibernet, which explains the earlier DNS resolution issues you were having with your Raspberry Pi. The `portalv6test.actcorp.in` redirection you saw previously is related to ACT's captive portal system.

Your IPv4 forcing approach (`-o Acquire::ForceIPv4=true`) was the correct solution since it bypasses potential issues with ACT's IPv6 DNS configuration.

User 1: also there is no dhcpcd service in my raspbian. It is networkmanager that worker. However, when i restarted previously it reset to the act dns values.. 

Taking all this into consideration how to I proceed with static ip setup for my pihole in raspberry pi zero

GitHub Copilot: # Setting Up Static IP for Pi-hole with NetworkManager

Since you're using NetworkManager instead of dhcpcd and your settings are reverting after restart, let's configure a static IP that will persist across reboots.

## Step 1: Identify your current connection

```bash
nmcli connection show
```

This will display a list of your network connections. Look for the active one (likely named "Wired connection 1" for Ethernet or something with "wlan0" for WiFi).

## Step 2: Set up static IP using nmcli

Replace `CONNECTION_NAME` with your actual connection name from step 1:

```bash
# For WiFi connection (replace values with your network information)
sudo nmcli connection modify "CONNECTION_NAME" \
    ipv4.method manual \
    ipv4.addresses 192.168.68.200/24 \
    ipv4.gateway 192.168.68.1 \
    ipv4.dns "127.0.0.1,8.8.8.8" \
    ipv4.dns-search ""
```

Notes:
- Choose an unused IP address on your network (I suggested 192.168.68.200 based on your network being 192.168.68.x)
- The gateway is likely 192.168.68.1 based on your subnet
- DNS is set to 127.0.0.1 (Pi-hole itself) and 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS as backup)

## Step 3: Disable automatic DNS from DHCP

This is critical to prevent your ISP's DNS servers from overwriting your settings:

```bash
sudo nmcli connection modify "CONNECTION_NAME" ipv4.ignore-auto-dns yes
```

## Step 4: Apply the changes

```bash
sudo nmcli connection down "CONNECTION_NAME"
sudo nmcli connection up "CONNECTION_NAME"
```

## Step 5: Verify configuration

Check that your settings were applied:

```bash
ip addr
nmcli -p connection show "CONNECTION_NAME"
```

## Step 6: Make settings persist through updates

Create a NetworkManager dispatcher script:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-dns-settings
```

Add this content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
CONNECTION_NAME="CONNECTION_NAME"  # Replace with your connection name

if [ "$2" = "up" ]; then
    nmcli con mod "$CONNECTION_NAME" ipv4.ignore-auto-dns yes
    nmcli con mod "$CONNECTION_NAME" ipv4.dns "127.0.0.1,8.8.8.8"
fi
```

Make it executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-dns-settings
```

This script will run whenever your connection is brought up, ensuring your DNS settings are preserved.

Now your Pi-hole should maintain a consistent IP address and DNS settings even after reboots, making it reliable as a DNS server for your network.

User 1: It is Wired connection 1
and let's use 192.168.68.120 as static ip

Now give me the exact commands to run 


GitHub Copilot: # Static IP Setup Commands for Pi-hole on Raspberry Pi

Here are the exact commands to configure your Raspberry Pi with a static IP address (192.168.68.120) for Pi-hole using NetworkManager:

## 1. Set Static IP Configuration

```bash
# Configure static IP with NetworkManager
sudo nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" \
    ipv4.method manual \
    ipv4.addresses 192.168.68.120/24 \
    ipv4.gateway 192.168.68.1 \
    ipv4.dns "127.0.0.1,8.8.8.8" \
    ipv4.dns-search ""
```

## 2. Prevent DNS Overrides from DHCP

```bash
# Ensure DNS settings won't be overwritten
sudo nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" ipv4.ignore-auto-dns yes
```

## 3. Apply the Changes

```bash
# Apply the new configuration
sudo nmcli connection down "Wired connection 1"
sudo nmcli connection up "Wired connection 1"
```

## 4. Verify Your Configuration

```bash
# Check if the changes were applied
ip addr
nmcli -p connection show "Wired connection 1" | grep -E "ipv4|IP4"
```

## 5. Make Settings Persist Across Reboots

```bash
# Create a script to maintain settings
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-dns-settings
```

Add this content to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$2" = "up" ]; then
    nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.ignore-auto-dns yes
    nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.dns "127.0.0.1,8.8.8.8"
fi
```

Then make the script executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-dns-settings
```

These commands will configure your Raspberry Pi with a static IP of 192.168.68.120, which will be used for your Pi-hole installation.

User 1: Perfectly. Done. 

Let's now move forward. What should I do

GitHub Copilot: # Next Steps for Pi-hole Setup

Now that you've successfully configured your static IP address (192.168.68.120) using NetworkManager, let's proceed with the Pi-hole installation and configuration:

## 1. Install Pi-hole

```bash
curl -sSL --ipv4 https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
```

## 2. During Pi-hole installation:

- Select your network interface (either `eth0` or `wlan0` depending on your connection)
- When asked about the static IP, choose "Yes" as we've already configured it
- Select your upstream DNS provider (Google, Cloudflare, etc.)
- Select blocklists you want to use
- Enable the web admin interface (recommended)
- Install the web server (lighttpd)
- Enable query logging if desired

## 3. After installation:

- Note the admin password displayed at the end of installation
- Access the Pi-hole admin interface by visiting `http://192.168.68.120/admin` from any device on your network

## 4. Configure your router to use Pi-hole:

- Access your router's admin interface
- Find the DHCP/DNS settings
- Change the primary DNS server to 192.168.68.120 (your Raspberry Pi's IP)
- Save changes and restart router if required

## 5. Test your Pi-hole installation:

- Visit `pi-hole.net/testsites` from a device on your network
- You should see ads blocked on the test pages
- Check the Pi-hole dashboard to confirm it's working

Would you like help with any specific part of the installation process?

User 1: Is primary dns enough to setup on router.. 

GitHub Copilot: # DNS Configuration for Pi-hole

For optimal Pi-hole operation, configuring just the primary DNS server on your router is technically sufficient but not recommended for reliability. Here's why:

## Primary DNS Only (Minimal Setup)

```
Primary DNS: 192.168.68.120 (Your Pi-hole)
```

This will direct all DNS queries to your Pi-hole, which will:
- Block ads according to your blocklists
- Forward legitimate queries to the upstream DNS you configured

## Recommended Setup (Primary + Secondary)

```
Primary DNS: 192.168.68.120 (Your Pi-hole)
Secondary DNS: Empty or Pi-hole IP again
```

**Important:** Do not set your secondary DNS to another public DNS server (like 8.8.8.8) as this would:
- Allow devices to bypass Pi-hole when primary is slow or unavailable
- Result in some ads getting through
- Make your blocking statistics incomplete

## Best Practice

If reliability is a concern, consider:
1. Setting only Pi-hole as DNS on your router
2. Configuring Pi-hole itself with multiple upstream DNS providers
3. For maximum reliability, set up a second Pi-hole instance on another device as your secondary DNS

This ensures all DNS traffic goes through Pi-hole while maintaining redundancy at the upstream level.

User 1: When I changed the primanry, i got the following error

This ip conflicts with the lan subnet. . To use this dns server, set it at DHCP Server

GitHub Copilot: # Router DNS Configuration Error

The error you're seeing occurs because you're trying to set your Pi-hole's IP address (192.168.68.120) directly in the router's primary DNS field, but it's within your LAN subnet.

## How to Fix This

Most routers require you to configure internal DNS servers through the DHCP server settings instead:

1. **Locate DHCP server settings**:
   - Look for a section in your router called "DHCP Server," "DHCP Settings," or "LAN Setup"
   - This is different from the WAN/Internet DNS settings

2. **Configure DNS in DHCP settings**:
   - Set the primary DNS server that will be distributed to clients as 192.168.68.120
   - Leave secondary DNS blank or set to your router's IP (for fallback)

3. **Apply settings and restart DHCP service** (if required)

## Why This Happens

This is a security/configuration restriction. Many routers won't allow setting a LAN IP address directly as a DNS server in the main DNS fields (which are often intended for external DNS servers). Instead, they require you to distribute internal DNS servers through DHCP.

## After Configuration

After setting this up correctly, devices on your network will receive the Pi-hole IP as their DNS server when they request an IP address via DHCP, ensuring all DNS queries are processed through Pi-hole.

User 1: I have updated the dns server in DHCP and rebooted my router. Do I need to manually set this dns at the respective devices because i am still seeing different man dns setting of  router. How do i validate the working of pi hole

GitHub Copilot: # Validating Your Pi-hole Setup

## About DNS Configuration

When you update DNS settings in your router's DHCP server, existing devices won't receive the new settings until:

1. Their DHCP lease expires and is renewed
2. They reconnect to the network
3. You manually release/renew their IP address

The different DNS settings you're seeing are likely because routers often have separate DNS settings for:
- LAN/DHCP (what gets sent to client devices) - this is where you set Pi-hole
- WAN/Internet (what the router itself uses) - this may still show your ISP's DNS

## How to Validate Pi-hole is Working

### 1. Check Pi-hole Admin Dashboard

```bash
# Access the admin dashboard in a browser
http://192.168.68.120/admin
```

Look for:
- Active query logs in the dashboard
- The graph showing DNS queries and blocked content

### 2. Check Device DNS Settings

**On Windows:**
```
ipconfig /all | findstr "DNS"
```

**On Linux/Mac/Raspberry Pi:**
```bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

These should show 192.168.68.120 as your DNS server.

### 3. Force Devices to Update DNS

**On Windows:**
```
ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew
```

**On Linux/Mac:**
```bash
sudo dhclient -r
sudo dhclient
```

### 4. Test Ad Blocking

Visit ad-heavy sites like:
- news.yahoo.com
- speedtest.net

Or visit Pi-hole's test page:
- pi-hole.net/testsites

### 5. Run DNS Lookup Tests

```bash
nslookup doubleclick.net
```

If Pi-hole is working, this should resolve to your Pi-hole IP (192.168.68.120).

If devices are still not using Pi-hole, you might need to:
1. Manually set DNS on individual devices temporarily
2. Wait longer for DHCP leases to expire
3. Check if your router has any DNS override settings that need changing

User 1: C:\Users\cmuppala>ipconfig  | findstr "DNS"
   Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
   Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
   Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
   Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
   DNS Servers . . . . . . . . . . . : 2406:b400:8:1::2
   Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :

   This is the output in my windows.. Do you think it is updated

GitHub Copilot: # DNS Configuration Check

Based on the output, your device is **not** using Pi-hole as its DNS server. The only DNS server showing is `2406:b400:8:1::2`, which is an IPv6 address from ACT Fibernet (your ISP), not your Pi-hole address (`192.168.68.120`).

## Why This Is Happening

Several possibilities:
1. Your router's DHCP settings haven't fully propagated to your device yet
2. Your device might need to release/renew its IP lease
3. Your router might be preferring IPv6 DNS over IPv4
4. Pi-hole is configured for IPv4 only, but your computer is using IPv6 for DNS

## Next Steps

1. **Force a DHCP renewal on your Windows PC**:
   ```
   ipconfig /release
   ipconfig /renew
   ```

2. **Display full DNS information**:
   ```
   ipconfig /all
   ```
   Look for both IPv4 and IPv6 DNS server entries

3. **Check your router settings** to ensure:
   - Both IPv4 and IPv6 DNS servers are set to your Pi-hole
   - IPv6 DNS settings aren't overriding your IPv4 settings

4. **Verify Pi-hole is working** by checking the admin dashboard:
   ```
   http://192.168.68.120/admin
   ```
   See if it's showing any queries or blocked domains

If you want to force the use of Pi-hole regardless of DHCP, you can manually set your DNS server to 192.168.68.120 in your network adapter settings.

User 1: I tried release and reneew. Not refreshing. It is still showing the Ipv6 dns. 
What if I disable ipv6 in the router. Is that recommended

GitHub Copilot: # IPv6 DNS Issue with Pi-hole

Yes, disabling IPv6 in your router is a valid solution that will force your devices to use the Pi-hole IPv4 DNS server. This is a common approach when setting up Pi-hole in networks where IPv6 is causing DNS bypassing issues.

## Option 1: Disable IPv6 in router

This is a straightforward solution:
- Access your router's admin interface
- Look for IPv6 settings (often under WAN, Network, or Advanced settings)
- Disable IPv6 completely
- Reboot your router

**Pros:**
- Forces all DNS requests through your Pi-hole
- Simple to implement
- Ensures consistent ad-blocking across all devices

**Cons:**
- You lose IPv6 connectivity (usually not a problem for most home users)
- Some modern services prefer IPv6 when available

## Option 2: Configure Pi-hole for IPv6

If you want to keep IPv6 enabled:

1. **Assign an IPv6 address to your Pi-hole**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/Wired\ connection\ 1.nmconnection
   ```
   
   Find the `[ipv6]` section and modify:
   ```
   [ipv6]
   method=manual
   addresses=your-ipv6-prefix::120/64
   ```

2. **Configure your router to use Pi-hole for both IPv4 and IPv6 DNS**

## Option 3: DNS Priority Override in Windows

If you only need to fix specific Windows devices:
```
netsh interface ipv6 set dnsservers "Wi-Fi" static 192.168.68.120 primary
netsh interface ipv4 set dnsservers "Wi-Fi" static 192.168.68.120 primary
```

For most Pi-hole setups, **Option 1 (disabling IPv6)** is the simplest and most reliable solution to ensure all your DNS traffic goes through Pi-hole.

User 1: netsh interface ipv6 set dnsservers "Wi-Fi" static 192.168.68.120 primary
The parameter is incorrect.      

Only second one worked 
netsh interface ipv4 set dnsservers "Wi-Fi" static 192.168.68.120 primary

Final output
  DNS Servers . . . . . . . . . . . : 2406:b400:8:1::2
                                       2406:b400:50:7::2
                                       192.168.68.120



GitHub Copilot: # IPv6 DNS Configuration Issue

The error occurs because you're trying to set an IPv4 address (192.168.68.120) as an IPv6 DNS server, which isn't valid. The final output shows Windows is still using your ISP's IPv6 DNS servers first, which means many DNS requests will bypass Pi-hole.

## Options to Fix This

### Option 1: Disable IPv6 DNS (Recommended)

To force all DNS traffic through Pi-hole, disable the IPv6 DNS servers:

```
netsh interface ipv6 set dnsservers "Wi-Fi" static :: none
```

### Option 2: Disable IPv6 Entirely on Your Network Adapter

This is more aggressive but guarantees all DNS goes through Pi-hole:

1. Open Network Connections (Win+R, type `ncpa.cpl`)
2. Right-click your Wi-Fi adapter → Properties
3. Uncheck "Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)"
4. Click OK

### Option 3: Check if Pi-hole is Working

To verify if Pi-hole is blocking ads despite the IPv6 DNS servers:

1. Visit the Pi-hole admin dashboard: http://192.168.68.120/admin
2. Check if queries are being logged
3. Try visiting an ad-heavy website to see if ads are blocked

Even with both IPv4 and IPv6 DNS servers configured, Pi-hole should work for some traffic, but for maximum effectiveness, Options 1 or 2 are recommended.

User 1: How do I bring back the changes. I have finished my testing

GitHub Copilot: # Reverting Pi-hole Testing Configuration

Since you've finished your Pi-hole testing, here's how to revert the changes you made:

## 1. Restore Windows DNS Settings

To return your Windows machine to using DHCP-assigned DNS servers:

```
netsh interface ipv4 set dnsservers "Wi-Fi" dhcp
```

This will remove the manual DNS entry (192.168.68.120) and allow your computer to get DNS servers automatically from your router.

## 2. Optional: Restore Raspberry Pi's Dynamic IP

If you want to remove the static IP from your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
sudo nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" \
    ipv4.method auto \
    ipv4.addresses "" \
    ipv4.gateway "" \
    ipv4.dns ""

sudo nmcli connection down "Wired connection 1"
sudo nmcli connection up "Wired connection 1"
```

## 3. Verify Your DNS Settings

On your Windows machine, check that DNS is properly restored:

```
ipconfig /all | findstr "DNS"
```

You should now see your ISP's DNS servers again, not the Pi-hole IP.

If you want to keep Pi-hole active while returning your Windows machine to normal, you can configure Pi-hole as your router's DNS server instead of setting it individually on each device.

User 1: netsh interface ipv6 set dnsservers "Wi-Fi" static :: none

How do i enable this

GitHub Copilot: # Running the IPv6 DNS Disable Command

To execute the command that disables IPv6 DNS servers on your Wi-Fi interface:

1. **Open Command Prompt with Administrator privileges**:
   - Click Start
   - Type "cmd"
   - Right-click on "Command Prompt" and select "Run as administrator"
   - Click "Yes" on the UAC prompt

2. **Run the command**:
   ```
   netsh interface ipv6 set dnsservers "Wi-Fi" static :: none
   ```

3. **Verify it worked** by checking your DNS configuration:
   ```
   ipconfig /all | findstr "DNS"
   ```

You should no longer see the IPv6 DNS servers in the output. If successful, your device will now only use the IPv4 DNS server (your Pi-hole at 192.168.68.120), ensuring all your DNS requests go through Pi-hole.

If you want to make this change persistent across reboots, you'll need to create a startup script or make the change through the Windows network adapter properties GUI.

User 1: No no. I am asking since we disabled ipv6 in windows . how do i enable it back 

GitHub Copilot: # Re-enabling IPv6 DNS in Windows

To re-enable IPv6 DNS settings in Windows after previously disabling them, you need to set the DNS servers back to DHCP-assigned mode:

```
netsh interface ipv6 set dnsservers "Wi-Fi" dhcp
```

This command will revert your IPv6 DNS configuration to automatically obtain DNS servers from your router through DHCP. After running this command, your Windows machine should start using IPv6 DNS servers again as provided by your network.

You can verify the change worked by checking your DNS settings:

```
ipconfig /all | findstr "DNS"
```

You should see your IPv6 DNS servers listed again in the output (likely the ACT Fibernet DNS servers you had before).

User 1: ideally if i change my hdcp settings and restart the router. Everything should change back right 

GitHub Copilot: # Restoring Network Settings After Pi-hole Testing

Yes, if you change your router's DHCP settings back to their original values and restart the router, most devices on your network will eventually return to their previous DNS configuration. However, there are a few important considerations:

## What Will Happen

1. **New devices** connecting to the network will get the updated DNS settings
2. **Existing devices** will get the new settings when their DHCP lease expires and is renewed
3. **Router-level settings** will be restored immediately

## What Won't Change Automatically

Your Windows PC where you manually set the DNS servers with the `netsh` commands won't automatically revert. Since you used static DNS configuration commands:

```
netsh interface ipv4 set dnsservers "Wi-Fi" static 192.168.68.120 primary
netsh interface ipv6 set dnsservers "Wi-Fi" static :: none
```

You'll need to manually change these back to DHCP mode with:

```
netsh interface ipv4 set dnsservers "Wi-Fi" dhcp
netsh interface ipv6 set dnsservers "Wi-Fi" dhcp
```

## To Speed Up the Process

For other devices, you can force them to get new network settings by:
- Disconnecting and reconnecting to the network
- On Windows devices: `ipconfig /release` followed by `ipconfig /renew`
- On mobile devices: toggle airplane mode or Wi-Fi off and on

This ensures all devices pick up the router's restored DNS configuration more quickly.

- Validation

## Overview
Pi-hole is a network-wide ad blocker that acts as a DNS sinkhole to block unwanted content before it reaches your devices. This guide documents the setup process on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2.

## Prerequisites
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 with Raspbian OS installed
- Network connection
- Router access (for DHCP configuration)

## Installation Steps

1. Update package repositories (with IPv4 forcing due to DNS issues):
   ```bash
   sudo apt update -o Acquire::ForceIPv4=true
   sudo apt upgrade -o Acquire::ForceIPv4=true
   ```

2. Configure static IP address using NetworkManager:
   ```bash
   sudo nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" \
       ipv4.method manual \
       ipv4.addresses 192.168.68.120/24 \
       ipv4.gateway 192.168.68.1 \
       ipv4.dns "127.0.0.1,8.8.8.8" \
       ipv4.dns-search ""
   ```

3. Prevent DNS overrides from DHCP:
   ```bash
   sudo nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" ipv4.ignore-auto-dns yes
   ```

4. Apply network configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo nmcli connection down "Wired connection 1"
   sudo nmcli connection up "Wired connection 1"
   ```

5. Install Pi-hole:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL --ipv4 https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
   ```

## Network Configuration

### Static IP Setup
- Used NetworkManager (instead of dhcpcd) to configure static IP address at 192.168.68.120
- Created persistent DNS settings that wouldn't be overwritten by ACT Fibernet's DNS servers
- Restarted NetworkManager with: `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager`

### DNS Configuration
- Configured router's DHCP server to distribute Pi-hole IP (192.168.68.120) as DNS server
- Set client devices to use Pi-hole for DNS resolution
- For Windows clients with persistent IPv6 DNS settings, used these commands:
  ```
  netsh interface ipv4 set dnsservers "Wi-Fi" static 192.168.68.120 primary
  netsh interface ipv6 set dnsservers "Wi-Fi" static :: none
  ```

## Troubleshooting

### DNS Resolution Issues
- Fixed ACT Fibernet DNS redirection issues by forcing IPv4 for apt:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update -o Acquire::ForceIPv4=true
  ```
- Made this setting permanent by creating configuration file:
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99force-ipv4
  # Added line: Acquire::ForceIPv4 "true";
  ```

### Network Connectivity
- Identified correct network service (NetworkManager instead of networking.service)
- Verified static IP configuration with: `ip addr`
- Tested DNS resolution with: `nslookup doubleclick.net`

### IPv6 DNS Issues
- Identified issues with IPv6 DNS servers bypassing Pi-hole
- Disabled IPv6 DNS on client devices using:
  ```
  netsh interface ipv6 set dnsservers "Wi-Fi" static :: none
  ```
- Restored normal DNS settings after testing with:
  ```
  netsh interface ipv4 set dnsservers "Wi-Fi" dhcp
  netsh interface ipv6 set dnsservers "Wi-Fi" dhcp
  ```

## Validation
- Verified Pi-hole installation by accessing admin dashboard at http://192.168.68.120/admin
- Tested ad blocking by visiting ad-heavy websites
- Confirmed DNS resolution was properly routing through Pi-hole

# Pi-hole Installation and Configuration Guide for Raspberry Pi

## Introduction
This guide documents the process of installing and configuring Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2. Pi-hole is a network-wide ad blocker that functions as a DNS sinkhole to block unwanted content before it reaches any devices on your network.

## Initial DNS Resolution Issue

When attempting to update the system, the following error was encountered:

```
Err:2 http://deb.debian.org/debian-security bookworm-security InRelease
  Could not resolve 'portalv6test.actcorp.in?mac=bc:07:1d:42:a3'
Err:3 http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates InRelease
  Could not resolve 'portalv6test.actcorp.in?mac=bc:07:1d:42:a3'
Err:4 http://archive.raspberrypi.com/debian bookworm InRelease
  Could not resolve 'portalv6test.actcorp.in?mac=bc:07:1d:42:a3'
Reading package lists... Done
W: Failed to fetch http://deb.debian.org/debian/dists/bookworm/InRelease Could not resolve 'portalv6test.actcorp.in?mac=bc:07:1d:42:a3'
```

This indicated that DNS resolution was being redirected to the ISP's captive portal (`portalv6test.actcorp.in`).

## Resolving DNS Issues

Although regular web browsing worked, the repository updates were failing due to DNS resolution issues. The solution was to force IPv4 for apt:

```bash
sudo apt update -o Acquire::ForceIPv4=true
sudo apt upgrade -o Acquire::ForceIPv4=true
```

To make this change permanent:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99force-ipv4
```

With the content:
```
Acquire::ForceIPv4 "true";
```

## Pi-hole Installation

### Prerequisites
- Updated Raspberry Pi OS
- Working internet connection
- Router admin access

### System Update
```bash
sudo apt update -o Acquire::ForceIPv4=true
sudo apt upgrade -o Acquire::ForceIPv4=true
```

### Setting Up Static IP

Since the Raspberry Pi uses NetworkManager (not dhcpcd), we configured a static IP with:

```bash
sudo nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" \
    ipv4.method manual \
    ipv4.addresses 192.168.68.120/24 \
    ipv4.gateway 192.168.68.1 \
    ipv4.dns "127.0.0.1,8.8.8.8" \
    ipv4.dns-search ""

sudo nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" ipv4.ignore-auto-dns yes
```

Applied the changes:
```bash
sudo nmcli connection down "Wired connection 1"
sudo nmcli connection up "Wired connection 1"
```

### Installing Pi-hole

```bash
curl -sSL --ipv4 https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
```

During installation:
- Selected the network interface (Wired/eth0)
- Confirmed the static IP address (192.168.68.120)
- Selected upstream DNS provider
- Chose default blocklists
- Enabled web admin interface
- Installed the web server (lighttpd)
- Enabled query logging

## Router Configuration

Modified the DHCP settings in the router to distribute Pi-hole as the DNS server:
1. Accessed router admin page
2. Located DHCP Server settings
3. Set the primary DNS server to 192.168.68.120
4. Applied settings and rebooted router

## Client Configuration

### Testing Pi-hole from Windows

Checked DNS settings on Windows:
```
ipconfig /all | findstr "DNS"
```

The output showed ISP's IPv6 DNS was still being used:
```
DNS Servers . . . . . . . . . . . : 2406:b400:8:1::2
```

### Forcing DNS settings on Windows

Modified Windows network settings to use Pi-hole exclusively:

```
netsh interface ipv4 set dnsservers "Wi-Fi" static 192.168.68.120 primary
netsh interface ipv6 set dnsservers "Wi-Fi" static :: none
```

Verified the changes:
```
ipconfig /all | findstr "DNS"
```

Final output showed all DNS servers:
```
DNS Servers . . . . . . . . . . . : 2406:b400:8:1::2
                                   2406:b400:50:7::2
                                   192.168.68.120
```

## Validation

- Accessed Pi-hole admin dashboard at `http://192.168.68.120/admin`
- Verified DNS queries were being logged
- Tested ad blocking functionality by visiting ad-heavy websites
- Confirmed DNS
